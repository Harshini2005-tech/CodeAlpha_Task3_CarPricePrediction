CodeAlpha Data Science Internship - Task 3: Car Price Prediction using Python and Machine Learning
>> CodeAlpha Internship — Task 3: Car Price Prediction

>> Objective
Predict car selling prices using machine learning models based on car attributes such as year, fuel type, transmission, and seller type.

---

>> Dataset
**File:** `car data.csv`  
**Columns include:**
- Car_Name  
- Year  
- Selling_Price  
- Present_Price  
- Kms_Driven  
- Fuel_Type  
- Seller_Type  
- Transmission  
- Owner  

---

>> Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Encoding  
4. Model Building — Linear Regression & Random Forest  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Insights & Recommendations  

---

>> Key Findings
- Newer cars and those with higher present prices have higher resale values.  
- Diesel cars generally have higher resale value than petrol cars.  
- Random Forest performed better with higher R² accuracy.

---

>> Conclusion
Machine learning models can effectively predict car resale prices, helping the automobile industry in better pricing and decision-making.
